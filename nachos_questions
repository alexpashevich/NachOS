Threads:
	Should we release address space on Exit sys call? (comment in progtest.cc ln:44)

	newThread->SaveUserState() - why we save state here? i guess we need to know stack pointer and rest registers but what if we run thread much later after we created it? data in thread's register backup won't be outdated?

	if so question is if value of oldSP should't be read before currentThread->RestoreUserState()? we could overwrite stack of other threads?

	do we need to init all regs to 0 before giving them meaningful values? we only need to change PCReg, NextPCReg, StackReg, and reg #4 for argument. is restoreUserState not enough? and do we really need to restore user registers explicitly? doesn't scheduler do that for us while switching between threads?
